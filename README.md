  Use 'git clone' to copy the repository to your local computer by typing "git clone git@github.com:robinsonfdossantos/Logo-Generator.git".
  
  ## Usage

  Run the terminal built into VS Code. Make sure you have installed all required packages using 'npm install or npm i' command, then run the program using 'node index.js or npm start' command.

  Go through all the questions, after you finish answering all of them a logo will be created and a copy will be saved in the ./examples directory with the name of the initials you used to create the logo, you can use the same name for different logos , but when saving it, a number will be added to its name to avoid duplicate files.
  
  After receiving the message that the logo has been created, you must open it in a browser to check the final result.
